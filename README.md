# mini-library
It is just a simple site in **pure PHP** to list informations :
* title of the book
* author of the book
* publication's year
* category

Each of attributes is linkable to another page with different informations listed on each of them.

**Get the site**
* 1 : clone the project 
* 2 : configure the db_connect_inc.php
* 3 : lazy guy ? you will find the structure of the database in files/

And that's it.

*For more fun, try to do the exact same thing without database but using only the .csv file, it was my challenge in first place, I'm still trying on that*
